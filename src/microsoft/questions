First Round:
	1. check if two words are permutation of each other
	
Final Round:
	1. return the size and the largest element in an integer array
	
	2. find the common nearest ancestor of two nodes in a tree. This tree is a bit different than a regular tree where each node has a
		pointer to its parent.
		
	3. given a schedule, let the user make a rectangle selections to return of timeline boxes then return: 
		Available, Conflict, Not available. the selection schedule forms a rectangle [we can run nested for loop].
		* I think the interview is looking for a testing ability because the answer is too straight forward. The full class can be think as
		an object where the big schedule represents all the employee schedule. I can't really write out the code here cause the interview gave me
		helper method. I think the best way to tackle this problem is to ask LOTS of questions and write out really good edge cases. some examples
		of edge cases are what if the coordinate of the given schedule is out of bound. The bigger schedule is null...etc test out happy cases as well.
	
	4. design problem to represent food entry in restaurant
		 * This is an open ended questions about design pattern.
